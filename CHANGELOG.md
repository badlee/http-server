## [0.0.6] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **MQTT TCP Multiplexing**: Enabled robust MQTT protocol support within shared `TCP` binder groups. MQTT can now share a single port with other protocols (like HTTP or DTP) using reactive peeking.
- **Dynamic MQTT Listener Injection**: Implemented "ghost" listener support for Mochi-MQTT, allowing the Binder to establish connections on behalf of the MQTT server without requiring a dedicated listening port.
- **Two-Phase Reactive Peeking**: Optimized the TCP peeking orchestrator to use a 1ms timeout for immediate matching, falling back to a full 2-second wait only when multiplexing is active. This ensures zero-latency for standard single-protocol ports.
- **Binder Parser Registry**: Registered `MQTT`, `DATABASE`, and `MAIL` as recognized protocol keywords in the binder parser, allowing nested configurations within `TCP` and `UDP` blocks.
- **Special Router Files Documentation**: Added exhaustive documentation for the FSRouter's special files system, including `_start.js`, `_close.js`, `_middleware.js`, `_layout`, method-specific fallbacks (`_GET.js`), and cron scripts (`*.cron.js`).

### Fixed
- **MQTT Protocol Matching**: Stiffened the MQTT matching logic to strictly validate CONNECT packet headers (inspecting the first 16 bytes), preventing misidentification of binary traffic as MQTT.
- **MQTT SSE Publishing Hooks**: Fixed a race condition/deadlock in the SSE Hub's MQTT publishing hook registration during server restarts.
- **FSRouter Fallback Logic**: Fixed a regression where method-specific routes in `module.exports` were not correctly prioritized over generic directory fallbacks.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Connection Peeking Optimization**: Eliminated the 512-byte `Peek` with a 2-second timeout for non-multiplexed protocols (such as HTTP, MQTT) when they are the only protocol bound to a port. This drastically reduces connection latency for standard setups by using a direct accept loop instead of the generic peeking orchestrator.
- **FsRouter Strict JS Routing**: Re-engineered `.js` file routing to cleanly separate backend routes from frontend static assets. Only files prefixed with a HTTP method/route (`_GET.js`, `_route.js`) or containing dynamic parameters (`[id].js`) are executed on the server. All other `.js` files (like `app.js` or `utils.js`) are served as standard static files.
- **FsRouter Priority Hierarchy**: Implemented a robust scoring system (`Static > Exact > Dynamic > Fallback`) ensuring predictable route resolution. Depth-based scoring ensures that nested routes correctly override root-level fallbacks.
- **Recursive Error Resolution**: Error handlers (`_404.js`, `_error.html`, etc.) are now resolved recursively by traversing upwards from the requested path. Added support for method-specific error handlers (e.g., `_404.POST.js`) and unified the `cfg.NotFound` hook for Go-based customization.
- **FsRouter Universal Export & 405 Handling**: `module.exports` in JS routes can now be defined directly as a function (acts as the `ANY` method). When exporting an object, method resolution is fully case-insensitive. If a request's HTTP method is not exported (and no `ANY` fallback is present) but the path exists, the router now returns a strict `405 Method Not Allowed` with a descriptive message.
- **FsRouter Directory Index Fallback**: Requests to a physical directory now automatically fallback to searching for an index file (e.g., `index.html`). This fallback is permissive for templates: a `POST` request to a directory will serve the `index.html` template even if it's registered as a `GET` route, facilitating simple hybrid workflows.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved the global HTTP error handler to return specific error messages (e.g., "Method not allowed", "Not found") instead of a generic "Internal Server Error" for common routing issues.

### Fixed
- **FsRouter Path Resolution**: Fixed a bug where the `ROUTER` directive with a single argument (e.g., `ROUTER .`) was incorrectly parsing the directory as the URL path, resulting in 404 errors. `ROUTER .` now correctly mounts the current directory to the root URL `/`.
- **Case-Insensitive Routing**: Updated `FsRouter` route matching to be fully case-insensitive for static files, exact routes, and dynamic parameters. `strings.EqualFold` is now used for URL matching, ensuring that paths like `/image/logo.png` correctly resolve to `./Images/logo.png` regardless of capitalization, matching Fiber's default case-insensitive behavior.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **FsRouter Hot-Reload**: Real-time route reloading via `fsnotify` watcher. New files automatically register routes, deleted files remove them, and renamed files trigger a full rescan — all with a 150ms debounce to avoid thrashing.
- **Intelligent File Cache**: TTL-based lazy-loading in-memory cache (`fileCache`) for `.js` and template files. Files are loaded on first request, served from memory on subsequent requests, and automatically evicted after inactivity. Eliminates redundant disk I/O in the request path.
- **Cache TTL Control**: New `--cache-ttl` CLI flag (default: `5m`) controls how long cached files remain in memory. Set to `0` or negative for permanent caching (no cleanup goroutine).
- **Per-Router Cache TTL**: New `cacheTtl` argument for the `ROUTER` directive in `.bind` files (e.g., `ROUTER / ./pages @[cacheTtl="10m"]`), allowing per-vhost or per-route cache tuning.
- **Thread-Safe Route State**: `routerState` with `sync.RWMutex` ensures concurrent-safe access to the routing table. The watcher writes under exclusive lock; request handlers read under shared lock via `snapshot()`.
- **Production Mode Optimization**: When `--hot-reload=false`, the file cache is permanent (no TTL expiration, no cleanup goroutine) and no `fsnotify` watcher is started, minimizing resource usage.
- **ProcessFile Cache Integration**: `processor.ProcessFile` transparently reads from the FsRouter cache (via `c.Locals("_fsrouter_cache")` interface) when available, with fallback to `os.ReadFile` for standalone usage.

### Fixed
- **FsRouter Test Suite**: Fixed 6 tests (`Export_WithSettings`, `404_CustomGoHandler`, `ErrorHandler_JS`, `ErrorHandler_Template`, `Settings_Template`, `Settings_JSHandler`) that panicked due to `app.Use(FsRouter(...))` unpacking the `(fiber.Handler, error)` tuple into Fiber's variadic `...any`, passing `nil` as a second handler. All tests now properly destructure the return value.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Unified Authentication System**: Centralized all authentication logic into a new `modules/auth` module.
- **Global AUTH DSL**: New top-level `AUTH [name] DEFINE` blocks supporting multiple sources: `USERS`, `USER`, `AUTH CSV`, and scripted `AUTH BEGIN`.
- **OAuth2 Client & Server**: Built-in support for OAuth2 social logins (`STRATEGY` block). Beba can now also act as a full OAuth2 Provider (`SERVER DEFINE` block) with standard endpoints (`/oauth2/authorize`, `/oauth2/token`, `/oauth2/userinfo`).
- **JWT & Session Management**: Built-in stateless JWT access token generation with database-backed JTI tracking for explicit token revocation.
- **HTTP AUTH Directive**: Mount authentication managers anywhere in your URL space using `AUTH [manager] [path]` within an `HTTP` block.
- **Unified JS API**: Expose the auth manager directly to JavaScript via `require('auth')`, providing programmatic `authenticate`, `generateToken`, `validateToken`, and `revokeToken` capabilities.
- **Unified APIs**: Standardized `/auth/login`, `/auth/me`, and `/auth/callback/:strategy` endpoints across all protocols.

### Changed
- Decoupled authentication from `modules/crud` and `modules/binder`.
- Refactored legacy authentication types (`AuthConfig`, `AuthResult`) to use the new plugin-based `Strategy` system.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Unified Startup Lifecycle**: Standardized the initialization process for single-website, `beba website`, and vhost modes using the `binder.Manager`.
- **Auto-generation of .vhost.bind**: Automatically creates and loads a default `.vhost.bind` configuration when starting in a directory without an explicit config.
- **DISABLE Directive**: New DSL directive `DISABLE [TYPE] [FEATURE]` (e.g., `DISABLE DEFAULT API`, `DISABLE ADMIN UI`) to programmatically deactivate core features.
- **Feature Toggling API**: Implemented `Enabled`, `Disabled`, `AnyEnabled`, and `AnyDisabled` methods on `DirectiveConfig` with strict and loose validation logic.
- **Performance Optimization**: Introduced RWMutex-backed caching for `DISABLE` lookups, significantly reducing string processing overhead during request handling.
- **Standardized CRUD API**: Standardized API paths (`/api/_schema`, `GET /api/:schema?first=true|last=true`) and relocated Admin UI to global `/_admin`.
- **Default Feature Injection**: Improved `HTTPDirective` to automatically mount default CRUD and Realtime endpoints while honoring `DISABLE` overrides.

### Changed
- Refactored `main.go` to remove redundant manual server initialization, relying on the Binder orchestrator.
- Moved default CRUD and Realtime initialization from `main.go` to `modules/binder/http_protocol.go`.

### Fixed
- Fixed handler signature mismatch for `sse.Handler` in the unified startup.
- Fixed missing port error when starting HTTP protocols with explicit `PORT` directives.
- Fixed syntax errors and stray braces in `main.go` and `http_protocol.go` during refactoring.
